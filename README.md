## Prerequisites
To get started with this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- A text editor for editing code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)
- A web browser to preview and test your project

## Setup
To use Flexbox CSS and jQuery in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred text editor.
3. Locate the HTML file (e.g., index.html) and open it.
4. Modify the HTML structure to suit your needs, adding classes or IDs where necessary.
5. Link the Flexbox CSS file by including the following code in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
